LTC Buses shows arrival times for London Transit buses (in London, Ontario, Canada). It shows arrival times of all buses at a particular stop, so you don't have to select a route first, so it's very quick and easy to use.

The release version is [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.frasermccrossan.ltc).

To answer the question from a reviewer on the Play store: this is a home-brew, just one developer at the moment. It shows no ads mainly on principle, but also because I have a good IT job and the small amount of extra money I'd earn from in-app ads isn't worth the annoyance to everyone who uses it. It's just a hobby project.
