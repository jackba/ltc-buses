The release version is [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.frasermccrossan.ltc). You only need to follow these instructions if you have encountered a problem and the developer wants you to try a test version.

To install, first enable non-market sources (in 2.2 Froyo: Settings > Applications > Unknown sources, in 4.0 ICS: Settings > Security > Unknown sources). Then download the [latest APK package](http://code.google.com/p/ltc-buses/downloads/list) on your phone or sideload via USB or SD card and open in a file manager.

NOTE: you'll probably need to remove the Google Play version, which means you'll lose all the downloaded data and have to download it again. Sorry, I don't know any way around that.
